# Risk Modeling the Probablity of Default (PD) model with Python
**This project estimates the probablity of default model using several machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It trains and tests the PD model using Decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, deep learning neural networks with five and four layers. Finaly, all of these models are compared based on the probablity of default prediction on the test data. The project uses diffrent performace metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve. Becuase this project focuses on idenetify bad borrowes, I rely more on the Recall/Sensetivity. Accordligly, the overall result shows that with 99.999 % recal rate, deep learning neural networks with 5 layers performs best**
